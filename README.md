I discovered at the end of the project that you have also asked for database, apparently I thought I just need to create few API's and little bit of frontend integration.
Therefore thr whole project is made without any database. Just few APIs

# NOTE: Please mention the necessary details on top as a requirements


### SetUp
    .env file under backend.
       - Please fill the variables without any value.
          - username
          - password
          - rapidapi_key

### Start the app
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

you can see the application running on -
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/
